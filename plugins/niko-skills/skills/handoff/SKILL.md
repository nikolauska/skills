# Handoff

Write the opening instructions your next session needs to pick up the work. The next session is a cold agent: same tools and checkout, zero memory of this one — its only input is this document. Every handoff is a briefing for a stranger, so it's a work order, not a report: it says what to do next, not what happened. There is no "we," nothing "we decided," no "where we left off" — if a line only makes sense to someone who was here, cut it. Size it to the next move, not to the session — a one-file fix earns a ten-line handoff, however long the session was.

One variable: does the reader already share this project? If yes, pointers can be bare paths and ticket IDs. If not (a teammate, a different context), strip originating-project assumptions and spell out where things live.

## Workflow

1. Write `Next` first: the one concrete action the next session starts with, specific enough for a cold start. Everything else gets in only by tracing to it.
2. Admit each further line by one test: **could the cold agent execute Next without this?** If yes, cut it — however much work it represents. "Important context" and "we decided this" don't count; a decision is recorded only if Next would otherwise violate it, and then as the rule, not its history.
3. If this conversation opened with a prior handoff, merge: carry what still constrains Next, drop the rest. Never append verbatim.
4. Budget check: the whole handoff fits on one screen (~150 words; more only if Next is genuinely multi-step). Longer means you drifted into reporting — cut, don't reorganize.
5. Present it directly in chat as one fenced Markdown block, ready to copy. Do not write it to a temp file or copy it to a clipboard.
6. Ask whether it needs changes. If not, tell the user to copy it, run `/clear`, and paste it as the first message. If edits are requested, present only the revised block and ask again.

## Format

Exactly these three sections, in order — no others. If you're reaching for a heading like Status, Progress, Decisions, Done, Evidence, Dead ends, or Parked, that's the report shape: the content either earns one line under a section below or dies. Drop a section with nothing in it.

    # Handoff — <topic or ticket>

    ## Next
    <one concrete action, specific enough to start cold. One sentence.>

    ## What the next move needs   (≤5 bullets, one line each)
    - <a file to touch / a rule to hold / a decision already made — stated as the rule, no backstory>
    - <a live blocker, only if the move is waiting on one: "Blocked on X — who/what unblocks it">

    ## Pointers
    - <path, URL, or ticket ID — an address, not its contents>

    Start with Next.

The closing line is load-bearing: without a closing imperative the fresh session tends to summarize the handoff back or ask what to do, instead of acting on `Next`.

A decision goes in as its rule, not its history:

    Report shape: "We chose the shared parser helper because the duplicate
    implementation drifted and caused inconsistent results..."
    Rule:         "- Use the shared parser helper, not a duplicate implementation. Settled."

## The test

Write only what the reader must do or not do next. A line earns its place by changing the next action — not by recording that something happened. Dead ends, settled-decision histories, and "what I accomplished" all fail it: the reader acts forward, and the code, `git log`, and standing docs (AGENTS.md, SPEC, TODO) already hold the past. Link to those; don't recount them. Never paste file contents, diffs, or command output.

## Red flags

- Reads like a report — narrates what happened instead of what to do next. The reader was never here; the past is unusable to them.
- A dumping section — dead ends, decision backstories, deferred-work logs. If the next move won't act on it, the cold agent can't use it.
- `Next` missing, vague, or not first.
- Handoff longer than one screen, or longer than the work `Next` describes.
- Restating what `git log`, the code, or standing docs already hold.
- Prior handoff appended instead of merged.
- Printing the handoff more than once without a requested revision.
