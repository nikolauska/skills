# Security Review

Review the diff for exploitable security failures. Report only findings with a concrete attack path, trust-boundary failure, or unsafe default — the Scope buckets below are where attack paths hide, not a checklist to sweep.

## Scope

### 1. Trust boundaries and access control

- auth and trust boundaries
- authorization gaps between clients, sessions, and operations
- endpoint exposure and listener defaults

### 2. Transport and encryption

- transport security (HTTP vs HTTPS, WS vs WSS)
- sensitive payloads traversing insecure channels
- key/secret handling: env-based sourcing, redacted logs, no plaintext persistence

### 3. Execution boundaries

- path boundary enforcement for file operations
- path traversal and escaping project roots
- shell/command execution safety
- queries or commands built by string concatenation instead of parameterization
- dynamic operations without an explicit allowlist
- destructive operations without appropriate guards

### 4. Protocol abuse and resource exhaustion

- malformed payload handling and schema validation
- queue flooding, oversized input, replayable requests
- timeout/retry/cancel consistency
- unbounded work, logs, or memory growth

### 5. Secret exposure

- secrets in logs, errors, traces, or test fixtures
- error messages exposing tokens, paths, or private context

### 6. Defaults and dependencies

- config defaults creating insecure behavior
- unsafe opt-out flags or weak default modes
- broad bypass options that disable enforcement when a narrower exception would do
- unpinned or known-vulnerable dependencies

## Evidence threshold

Only report findings with a concrete attack path, trust-boundary failure, or unsafe default. No speculative recommendations without a plausible abuse path.

## Workflow

1. Map entry points and trust boundaries in the diff; flag pre-existing code only where the change newly makes it reachable.
2. Classify each: local-only, authenticated, remote-accessible, privileged.
3. Check validation, authorization, safe defaults at each boundary. For large audits, fan out **fast-tier** readers — one per boundary or subsystem — to collect raw candidates. Verify each against the code before reporting.
4. Identify exploitable paths (read, write, execute, network, persist).
5. Report findings by severity: critical → high → medium → low.

## Output

For each finding: **label** (Critical / Fix / Consider / Nit — see `review`), **affected files**, **attack/failure path** (who can reach it), **why risky**, **fix**, **test idea**. Severity follows reachability: Critical = reachable by remote unauthenticated input; Fix = authenticated or same-network; Consider/Nit = requires local access or defense-in-depth.

- Reject: "The WebSocket uses WS not WSS — should be encrypted." (no reachable attack path)
- Report: **Critical** — `server.ts:42` binds `0.0.0.0` with `auth:false` by default; any LAN host can call `/exec` and run shell commands (unauthenticated network → execute).

Group as **Confirmed findings** | **Open questions** | **Optional hardening** (max 3, one line each, only where an abuse path is plausible; omit if empty). "No security findings" is a valid result.
